# Parallel-Domain-Decomposition</br>

This repository contains codes for solving a linear system Ax=b using domain decomposition method.Here the coefficient matrix A has been extracted from the BA problem, which gives the matrix an arrowhead structure.</br>
The domain decomposition will be parallelised using MPI library in C(openmpi/3.0.0).</br>
